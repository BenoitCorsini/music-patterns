# Music patterns

This project contains the code that can:
* Find the _guitarpro_ tablatures of songs online.
* Transform the tablatures into pattern matrices and images.
* Computes statistics on these pattern matrices.

It is meant to represent the work in [Similarity of structure in popular music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13728).

## Getting started

### Running the code

The library requirements for this code can be found in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run the following command line in the terminal:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once this is done or if the required libraries are already installed, run the following:
```sh
python main.py
